## About Deep Funding

Deep Funding is a decentralized funding mechanism that supports the development of tools and infrastructure for the Cardano ecosystem. Our mission is to empower developers and teams to build innovative solutions that strengthen the Cardano network.

### Strategic Pillars

#### Pillar 1: DF Rounds
Deep Funding operates through regular funding rounds where teams can submit proposals for tooling and infrastructure projects. Each round focuses on specific areas of need within the ecosystem.

#### Pillar 2: RFPs and Other Funding Routes
In addition to open rounds, Deep Funding issues Request for Proposals (RFPs) for specific technical challenges and infrastructure needs identified by the community.

#### Pillar 3: Developer Outreach
We actively engage with the developer community to identify needs, provide support, and ensure that funded projects align with ecosystem requirements.

### Main Tools and Environments
