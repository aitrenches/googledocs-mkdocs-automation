# Welcome to the Review Circle

The Review Circle is an essential unit within the Deep Funding program, under SingularityNET. It serves as a quality control and assessment team, focused on ensuring that proposals, milestones, and deliverables are evaluated with clarity, fairness, and alignment to Deep Funding’s vision of decentralized AI.

This team provides structure, transparency, and support to both proposers and the wider community — making sure project ideas are not just promising, but realistic and well executed.

Our Onboarding Guide.

We act as Deep Funding's Project Delivery Quality Assurance team — working behind the scenes to help awardees succeed.
